# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithm

The project detailed in the notebook is focused on developing a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model for trading strategies**. Here's a technical breakdown of the workflow:

1. **Data Import and Preparation**: 
   - The project begins by downloading financial data (OHLCV) from Yahoo Finance into a pandas DataFrame. This includes time-series stock data that will be processed and analyzed.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - The `ta` (technical analysis) library is employed to create relevant technical indicators and features that describe market conditions.
   - Feature correlations are analyzed, and highly correlated features are removed to enhance model performance by reducing redundancy.

3. **Train/Test Data Split**:
   - Data is split into training and testing sets using a sequential split, preserving the temporal structure necessary for accurate financial modeling.

4. **Custom Gym Environment for Trading**:
   - A reinforcement learning environment is created using `gym`. It includes:
     - **Action Space**: Defines the possible actions (buy, sell, hold).
     - **Observation Space**: Contains the input data used by the agent for decision-making.
     - **Reward Function**: Defines the feedback mechanism based on actions taken by the agent, linked to profit/loss or market performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Bayesian optimization is used to fine-tune the reinforcement learning model's hyperparameters to maximize trading performance.

6. **DRL Model Implementation**:
   - A Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is implemented using the `stable_baselines3` library, and the model is trained in the custom environment.
   
7. **Evaluation and Visualization**:
   - After training, the agentâ€™s performance is evaluated, and results are visualized to track trading strategies over time, including profits, losses, and bankruptcies.

The project uses a combination of Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `ta`, `yfinance`, and `stable_baselines3` to implement and train a trading agent in a reinforcement learning framework.
